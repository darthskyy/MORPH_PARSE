            <p>
                <dfn>Morphemes</dfn> are the smallest units of meaning in a language. They play an important role in creating
                meaning and grammatical syntax. This is especially true in agglutinative languages, such as the Nguni languages,
                which construct words by concatenating many morphemes. Many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, such as
                machine translation, can be improved by incorporating morphological information. However, methods to extract
                this information for the Nguni languages still need to be refined.

            <p>
                This paper evaluates the use of neural  methods in morphological parsing, or the labelling of morphemes
                with their corresponding grammatical role. We compare two main approaches:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="#from-scratch">Training neural models from scratch</a>, and</li>
                    <li><a href="#plms">Fine-tuning pre-trained language models.</a></li>
                </ul>

            <p>We <a href="#results">compared the performance</a> of these models with
                eachother as well as with traditional methods of solving the task, such as Finite State Transducer (FST) models.

            <p>
                We found that models trained from scratch outperformed both fine-tuned pre-trained language models and the
                traditional FST model. Models using morpheme-level embeddings and sentence-level context tended to perform the
                best.

            <h1>Introduction</h1>

            <p>
                Morphemes are the basic building blocks of meaning (semantics) in a language. By understanding the
                grammatical role that morphemes play in a sentence, we can solve downstream Natural Language Processing
                (NLP) tasks better. These tasks range from information retrieval to machine translation.

            <p>
                Splitting up text into its morphemes is known as <dfn>morphological segmentation.</dfn> There are two
                kinds of morphological segmentation: canonical and surface segmentation. <dfn>Canonical segmentation</dfn>
                splits the text into the full, underlying linguistic morphemes in their canonical forms. <dfn>Surface
                segmentation</dfn> splits the text into its <dfn>morphs</dfn>, which are the morphemes as they appear
                in the word after undergoing any sound or spelling changes that may occur.

                The goal of morphological parsing is to predict these morpheme tags for arbitrary text. In our project

            <p>
                Morphological information is especially important for NLP in Nguni languages for two main reasons:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Nguni languages are <dfn>agglutinative</dfn>, meaning many words are created by combining
                        multiple morphemes.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Nguni languages are written conjunctively, meaning that morphemes are concatenated into a single
                        word. For example, in isiXhosa, "andikambuzi" means "I haven't yet asked him", and is
                        composed of the morphemes "a", "ndi", "ka", "m", "buza", and "i".
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <p>
                Few morphological parsers exist for the Nguni languages. One example of a morphological parser is the
                rule-based <a href="https://portal.sadilar.org/FiniteState/demo/zulmorph/">ZulMorph parser for isiZulu.</a>
                Rule-based parsers require linguists to manually incorporate stems, affixes, and grammar rules into the
                software. This is a tedious process which requires a high degree of expertise.

            <p>
                By comparison, machine-learning approaches are data driven. Instead of manually incorporating information
                into the algorithm, the parser can be automatically generated from linguistically-annotated data. This
                means that the process is language agnostic and can leverage previously-existing datasets.

            <p>
                In this project, we investigated the use of neural methods for morphological parsing of Nguni languages.
                We took two main approaches to this:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Simbarashe Mawere examined the fine-tuning of pre-trained language models. Three different
                        pre-trained language models (PLMs) were evaluated, with varying levels of inclusion of Nguni
                        Languages. These were XLM-Roberta (XLM), Afro-XLMR, and Nguni-XLMR.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cael Marquard examined the use of training models from scratch. Two kinds of models were evaluated:
                        bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (bi-LSTM) models, and neural Conditional Random Fields (CRFs).
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <p>
                The three research questions that we aimed to answer were:
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Can neural approaches outperform traditional approaches to morphological parsing for the Nguni
                    languages?</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Do models trained from scratch or fine-tuned pre-trained language models perform better?</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Do models classifying surface segmentations or models classifying canonical segmentations
                    perform better?</strong></li>
                </ol>

            <p>
                In order to answer these questions, we compared the tagging quality of these models to each-other and
                to a traditional, rule-based approach
                (<a href="https://portal.sadilar.org/FiniteState/demo/zulmorph/">ZulMorph</a>) as a baseline. Comparisons
                were also made across segmentation type.

            <h1>Models Trained From Scratch</h1>
            <p class="author">Author: Cael Marquard</p>

            <h2>Models</h2>
            <p>
                Two architectures were chosen: Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) and
                neural Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). These architectures have both been successfully applied to the
                closely-related tasks of morphological segmentation and part-of-speech tagging for the Nguni languages.

            <h3>Bi-LSTMs</h3>
            <p>
                <dfn>Bi-LSTM</dfn> models are a type of <dfn>recurrent neural network</dfn> (RNN), a class of
                neural networks able to "remember" past inputs when computing future outputs. LSTMs are an
                RNN architecture which avoid issues such as vanishing and exploding gradients, and are popular for
                NLP tasks. Bidirectional LSTMs combine two separate LSTMs, one reading the input forward and one in
                reverse. This allows bi-LSTMs to take into account both the future <em>and</em> the past of the sequence
                that it is classifying in order to have better context.
            </p>

            <h3>CRFs</h3>

            <p>
                A <dfn>CRF</dfn> is a probabilistic model which explicitly models the statistical dependence of the output
                (label) sequence on the input sequence, as <em>well</em> as the dependence of the output sequence
                <em>on itself.</em> This allows them to explicitly model the grammar of the language. CRFs have been used
                for morphological segmentation as well as part-of-speech tagging in the Nguni languages. For this project,
                the CRF only models the interdependence of each label on the neighbouring labels and the input item.
                This linear chain approach is simpler to implement and more computationally efficient to train.

            <figure class="wide-figure">
                <img src="files/crf.png" alt="Diagram of a CRF organised as a linear chain. Each output label depends on
                 the previous and next output labels, as well as the input datum which it labels.">
                <figcaption>An example of a CRF organised as a linear chain. Diamonds represent input variables
                    <strong>X<sub>i</sub></strong>, circles represent output variables
                    <strong>Y<sub>i</sub></strong>, and edges represent statistical interdependence.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>CRFs usually rely on a set of hand-crafted features in order to assign probabilities. However, an
                alternative to this is to use a neural network to generate these features. In this project, a bi-LSTM
                is used to generate these features.

            <h2>Discussion</h2>
            <p><strong>Both Bi-LSTMs and CRFs performed well, without having any clear leader.</strong> Therefore, the added CRF
                layer did not significantly improve over the bi-LSTM that was generating its features. This could
                be as a result of the CRF being organised only as a linear chain &mdash; perhaps higher-order
                CRFs (which model dependence across more than just neighbours) could improve this.</p>
            <p><strong>Sentence-level models were usually better than their word-level counterparts.</strong>
                This makes intuitive sense, as in some cases, the added context allows for easier disambiguation.
                For instance, it is not  obvious from the prefix alone whether "ipolisa" should be in class 5 or
                class 9, since both have "i" as valid prefixes. However, if this is placed in the context of the
                sentence "ipolisa liyahamba", the  "li" prefix can be used to unambigously identify "ipolisa" as
                class 5.
            <p><strong>Models classifying canonical segmentations outperformed those classifying surface segmentations.</strong>
                This is likely because the canonical segmentation of a word provides more information to the model
                than the surface segmentation. For instance, the word "kwicandelo" is canonically segmented as
                "ku-i-(li)-candelo" and surface segmented as "kw-i-candelo". The "(li)" morpheme is lost in the
                surface form, which is the noun prefix for class 5. Without it, the model may have a harder time
                choosing between class 9 and 5 for the morpheme "i".
            </p>
            <p><strong>Models using morpheme-level embeddings outperformed character-level models.</strong>
                This could be because morphemes are simply a more effective representation for this task.
                Additionally, morpheme-level embeddings are more sensitive to small changes in the morpheme itself.
                Since each morpheme is mapped to its own learnt embedding, even a single differing character can
                yield an entirely different embedding. This lets the model identify rare classes more easily.
            </p>

            <h1>Pre-trained Language Models</h1>
            <p class="author">Author: Simbarashe Mawere</p>
            <p>Pre-trained language models (PLMs) are transformer based models that have been trained on large corpora of text, allowing them to learn the structure of language. They make use of masked language modelling (MLM) as the pre-training task from which the models gain the pre-learned word contexts and embeddings. This is a task where a word is masked and the model is task on predicting what it was. After this the model can be fine-tuned on data for a different task with considerable performance at reduced time and resource expenditure. <br><br>

            Beginning with BERT in there have been many models that have been developed and fine-tuned for different languages and tasks. These models have been shown to be effective in a wide range of NLP tasks and have been shown to be effective in low-resource languages. In this exploration we fine-tuned three models on the morphological parsing task for the Nguni languages. The models were XLM-RoBERTa, Afro-XLMR and Nguni-XLMR based on their varying levels of inclusion of the Nguni languages. <br><br>

            <h1>Results</h1>
            <p>The results for the exploration were split based on the data which the models were trained on. The first exploration in the project was using expertly annotated canonical segmentations which were obtained from the Sadilar dataset. For the other result sets we used canonical and surface segmentations predicted using the morphological segmenters from MORPH-SEGMENT. For the models trained from scratch the models are split into word- and sentence-level </p>
