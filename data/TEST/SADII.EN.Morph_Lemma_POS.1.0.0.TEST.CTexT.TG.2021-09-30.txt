In

there

be
differences

participation
in

Competence

capacity
of
school
principals
.
The
common
feature
of
all
well

schools
is
leadership
.
The
Department
of
Basic
Education
has
recently
launched
a
programme
to
measure
the
competencies
of
principals
and
deputy
principals
.
This
survey
will
also
help
identify
weak
performers
,
based
on
learner
scores
,
and
allow
for
appropriate
support
for
principals
and
teachers
.
Principals
should
be
selected
purely
on
merit
,
be
given
greater
powers
over
school
management
and
be
held
accountable
for
performance
.
<LINE# 1066>
When
developing
priorities
with

community
it
is
helpful
to
encourage
community

to
think
broadly
and
consider
the
short

and
long
term
needs
.
<LINE# 2077>
The
KPIs
apply
to
the
municipality
’s
administrative
units
and
employees
,
as
well
as
every
municipal
entity
and
service
provider
that
the

<LINE# 2301>
Municipalities
have
different
interests
and
they
may
find
that
they
compete
with
each
other
.
The
PMS
should
incorporate
as
many
of
these
interests
as
are
viable
and
sustainable
.
There
will
also
be
different
needs
in
rural
communities
from
those
of
urban

(

the

The

the

the

In

,
these

not
work
.
In

,
human

are
badly
planned
,
with
little
coordination
between
those
installing
water
reticulation
infrastructure
and
those
responsible
for
providing
bulk
infrastructure

Responsibility

the

Government

Cabinet

This

in

,
it

However
,
it
is
important
to
recognise
that
diversity
also
needs
to
be
seen
in
issues
relating
to
power
and
resources
.
Much
of
what
is
recognised
as
‘
diversity
’
emerged
due
to
power
relations
and
resource
allocation
issues
.
Differences
are
not
all
physically
predetermined
,
and
even
where
they
are
,
they
are
made
bigger
through
other
social
and
economic
constructs
.
In
many
instances
the
differences
between
rich
and
poor
;
employed
and
unemployed
;
urban
and
rural
;
educated
and
uneducated
are
socially
constructed
and
deeply
political
.
These
differences
have
little
to
do
with
the
physical
traits
with
which
an
individual
is
born
and
successful
diversity
management
will
require
attention
based

a
human

culture

One
of
the
main
objectives
of
government
has
been
to
transfer
responsibility
for
service
delivery
from
national
government
to
provincial
and
local
authorities
.
Service
delivery
should
be
in
the
hands
of
those
closest
to
the
end
-
users
rather
than
of
central
government
,
far
removed
from
the
actual
‘
front
-
line
’
.
It
must
still
fall
within
the
national
policy
frameworks
developed
by
the
relevant
national
government
departments
.
<LINE# 1821>
The
constitutional
framework
allows
for
more
differentiation
in
the
allocation
of
powers
and
functions
,
and
this
should
be
used
to
ensure
a
better
fit
between
the
capacity
and
responsibilities
of
provinces
and
municipalities
.
The
existing
system
can
be
improved
,
with
clarification
of
responsibilities
in
the
areas
of
housing
,
water
,
sanitation
,
electricity
and
public
transport
.
Large
cities
should
be
given
greater
fiscal
and
political
powers
to
coordinate
human
settlement
upgrading
,
transport
and
spatial
planning
.
In
other
areas
,
regional
utilities
could
provide
services
on
behalf
of
less
well
resourced
municipalities
,
but
this
must
be
led
by
municipalities
to
avoid
undermining
democratic
accountability
for
service
delivery
