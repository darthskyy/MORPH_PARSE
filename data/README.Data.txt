Project: SADiLaR-II: Linguistic corpus enrichment for conjuctively written South African languages.

Type: Parallel data annotated for morphology, lemmatisation and part-of-speech
Languages: 	isiNdebele (NR), isiXhosa (XH), isiZulu (ZU) & Siswati (SS). English (EN) tokens only.
Date: 2021-09-30
Version: 1.0 (final)

Description: 
The dataset contains a total of 1431 paragraphs and approx. 50,000 tokens for each of the languages. As this data has been used for the DHASA 2021 shared task (https://dh2021.digitalhumanities.org.za/shared-task/), all data has been split randomly by paragraphs into a 90% training and 10% testing part. The data is given in one train and one test text file for all languages. The start of each original paragraph is marked by a line marker with a counter. Each token/annotation combination can be found on a newline. Tokens and all annotation types (morphology, lemmas, parts-of-speech) are separated by a single tab character in the .txt file. The English file only contains tokens.
