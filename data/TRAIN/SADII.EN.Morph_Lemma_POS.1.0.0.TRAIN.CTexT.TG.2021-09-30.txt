There
may
be
competing
interests
from
the
different
wards
in
the
municipality
and
these
interests
need
to
be
taken
into
account
when
preparing
the
PMS
.
Each
Ward
Committee
in
the
municipality
will
be
keen
to
ensure
that
its
interests
are
included
.
For
example
,
a
ward
that
has
little
industry
and
high
unemployment
will
want
to
give
preference
to
creating
an
environment
that
encourages
industry
.
Another
ward
may
have
an
airport
and
its
concern
is
noise
and
pollution
.
The
PMS
should
try
include
as
many
interests
as
possible
taking
into
account
what
is
realistic
for
that
municipality
.

planning
requires
the
inclusion
of
all
stakeholders
in
the
planning
process
such
as
residents
,
councillors
,
municipal
officials
,
members
of
community
structures
such
as
Ward

and
CBOs
,
service

,
traditional

,
local

and

In
addition
to
political
will
,
corruption
has
to
be
fought
on
three
fronts
:
deterrence
,
prevention
and
education
.
Deterrence
helps
people
understand
that
they
are
likely
to
get
caught
and
punished
.
Prevention
is
about
systems
(
information
,
audit
and
so
on
)
that
make
it
hard
to
engage
in
corrupt
acts
.
The
social
dimensions
of
corruption
need
to
be
tackled
by
focusing
on
values
,
through
education
.

Several
structural
weaknesses
must
be
overcome
if
Africa
is
to
translate
rapid
growth
and
higher
demand
for
commodities
into
rising
employment
and
living
standards
.
Crucially
,
poor
transport
links
and
infrastructure
networks
,
as
well
as
tariff
and
non-tariff
barriers
,
raise
the
cost
of
doing
business
and
hobble
both
investment
and
internal
trade
.
Weak
legal
institutions
and
,
in
some
cases
,
poor
governance
heighten
the
risks
of
investing
.
The
picture
is
improving
steadily
,
but
challenges
remain
,
including
in
the
Southern
African
Development
Community
(
SADC
)
,
which
faces
hurdles
related
to
infrastructure
,
trade
barriers
and
governance
.
While
South
Africa
will
find
it
difficult
to
compete
in
low

because
of
its
high
cost
structure
,
many
countries
on
the
continent
can
compete
as
production
costs
rise
in
East
Asia
.
<LINE# 0336>
Effective
methodologies
need
to
examine
how
differences
can
be
acknowledged
and
valued
so
that
all
members
of
the

can
be
included
in
a
way
that
helps
the
municipality
accomplish
its
goals
in
ensuring
effective
service
delivery
through
public
participation
.
However
,
encouraging
and
accepting
diversity
is
not
only
about
setting
targets
,
or
even
learning
to
value
people
’s
differences
but
requires
creating
acceptance
and
encouring
mutual
tolerance
and

Continuous

A
major
challenge
is
that
poor
school
education
increases
the

of
producing

,
and
a

Increasing

combined
with

that
these

The

needs
to
have
an
annual

that
clearly
lays
out

report
to
the
municipality
,
as
it
can
report
each

against
its

.
It
is
a
good
idea
for
a
Ward
Committee
to
plan
a
special
meeting
as
soon
as
possible
to
develop
the
annual
action
plan
.
Ward
Committee
members
should
make
sure
that
their
plan
is
realistic
and
achievable
.
<LINE# 1178>
The
plan
is
a
tool
for
defining
where
the
community
wants
to
go
,
for
making
proposals
to
the
IDP
,
for
monitoring
progress
in
implementing
the
plan
,
and
can
be
updated
annually
as
projects
move
forward
,
and
new
priorities
emerge
.
When
the
plan
is
developed
,
ownership
can
be
improved
by
considering
how
else
the
contents
can
be
communicated
to
a
broad
range
of
community
groups
,
including
summaries
of
local
languages
,
posters
,
drama
.
This
should
be
discussed
at
the
community
finalisation
meeting

It
is
essential
that
key
elements
such
as
the
vision
and
objectives
are
translated
into
the
language
of
people
in
the
area
.
<LINE# 1715>
Transforming
the
economy
also
means
changing
patterns
of
ownership
and
control
.
To
date
,
efforts
to
transfer
ownership
of
productive
assets
have
not
yielded
the
desired
results
,
with
employee
share
ownership
schemes
playing
a
less
significant
role
.
A
bolder
approach
and
clearer
targets
are
required
.
Policy
instruments
to
encourage
the
private
sector
to
change
ownership
patterns
include
voluntary
scorecards
,
procurement
regulations
,
licensing
arrangements
(
such
as
in
telecommunications
and
mining
)
and
development
finance
.
<LINE# 1729>

that
a

The

also
gave

At

was
introduced

The
HIV

AIDS
epidemic
has
illustrated
South
Africa
’s
ability
to
make
monumental
social

political
mistakes
–
as
well
as
its
ability
to
correct
them
and
implement
a
complex
programme
effectively
.
The
health
system
’s
success
in
managing
the
epidemic
over
the
past
five
years
is
commendable
.
Yet
there
is
no
room
for
complacency
.
There
is
a
continuing
need
for
education
,
prevention
,
testing
and
treatment
.
Lowering
the
rate
of
new
infections
will
reduce
the
demand
on
the
public
health
system
.
Yet
even
if
there
are
no
new
infections
,
there
will
still
be
a
sizeable
number
of
HIV

people
requiring
treatment
,
posing
continuing
challenges
for
the
tuberculosis
infection
rate
and
the
risk
of

The
epidemic
and
its

for

are
likely
to
persist
for
at

another

states
that

When

the

will
consider
a

of
factors
including
the
financial

of
an
area
,
integration
of
racial
divisions
and
alignment
with
municipal

Power
-
based
approach
–
this
is
when
a
party
uses
its
real
or
perceived
position
of
power
to
try
and
force
its
opponent
to
act
in
a
specific
manner
.
This
approach
relies
on
force
or
coercion
to
seek
a
result
.
For
example
,
security
forces
arrest
demonstrators
who
have
barricaded
a
road
,
or
a
person
in
authority
at
work
makes
a
decision
that
some
of
the
workers
are
not
happy
with
but
are
unable
to
voice
their
opinion
because
of
the
senior
position
of
the
person
making
the

.
Typical
actions
of
a
power
-

approach
may
include
boycotts
,
strikes
,
demonstrations
,
mass
action
,
the
skilful
use

the

Globalisation
broadly
refers
to
rising
global
trade
and
increased
flows
of
people
,
capital
,
ideas
and
technologies
across
borders
in
recent
decades
.
These
trends
have
generally
supported
the
development
of
poor
and
middle
-
income
countries
,
enabling
them
to
access
markets
,
goods
,
services
,
capital
,
technology
and
skills
.
Globalisation
has
also
contributed
to
a
growing
“
interconnectedness
”
that
has
lowered
barriers
to
entry
and
expanded
the
reach
of
knowledge
.
<LINE# 1650>
In

,
South
Africa
has
to
respond

this
trend
by
bolstering
competitiveness

and
increasing

mineral
exports
.
Over

,
South

has
to
do
more
to
enhance
competitiveness
in
areas
of
comparative

that
can
draw
more

planning
.
Chapter
1
highlighted
that
a
community
-
based
plan
needs
to
be
prepared
by
local
people
for
their
ward
,
owned
by
the
community
and
ensure
the
active
participation
of
the
community
in
its
implementation
.
The
Ward
Committee
plays
an
important
part
in
ensuring
and
securing
community
participation
.
<LINE# 0857>
The
performance
of
all
individuals
,
teams
and
Private
Public
Partnerships
who
help
to
achieve
the
strategic
objectives
of
a
department
or
municipality
must
be
monitored
to
ensure
the
delivery
of
quality
services
.
Performance
of
individuals
will
be
appraised
according
to
the
performance
management
system
implemented
by
their
municipality
.
Self
-
assessments
and
peer
reviews
are
tools
used
in
the
evaluation
of
individuals
.

Resource
planning
:
Determining
what
resources
(
people

,
materials
)
and
what
quantities
of
each
will
be
needed
to
perform

activities
.
<LINE# 1179>
CBP
establishes
a
participatory
process
for
getting
input
from
the
community
and
planning
around
grassroots
issues
and
how
this
information
can
relate
to
the
broader
municipal
planning
perspective
.
Below
is
an
example
of
an
outline
of
the
ward
plan
and
relevant
for
the
IDP
.
<LINE# 1877>
Divide
participants
into
groups
of
3
.
Ask
each
group
to
think
about
and
write
down
what
each
of
the
following
is
responsible
for
.
They
should
think
about
their
own
municipality
when
answering
.
<LINE# 1797>
Public
employment
should
expand
,
with
a
focus
on
youth
and
women
.
It
is
expected
that
public
employment
will
provide
the
equivalent
of
2
million
full
-
time
jobs
by
2020
.
<LINE# 1071>
Communities
,
organisations
and
people
participate
for
different
reasons
and
bring
different
skills
and
experiences
that
can
help
the
process
.
The
table
on
page
21
outlines
the
type
of
participation
and
what
it
involves
.
<LINE# 1158>
Linking
the
CBP
and
IDP
outputs
is
a
cyclical
process
.
The
cycle
of
activities
outlined
in
CBP
needs
to
link
to
the
IDP
cycle
.
This
is
necessary
as
the
CBP
tries
to
ensure
that
communites
’
needs
are
identified
and
included
in
the
IDP
.
As
the
IDP
is
meant
to
reflect
the
priorities
of
the
community
,
if
these
cycles
are
not
aligned
communities
can
become
disillusioned
with
the
CBP
approach
to
planning
.
<LINE# 2241>
A
municipality
can
establish
a
development
stakeholder
cluster
where
they
can
bring
together
people
from
CBOs
and
NGOs
;
local
business
;
SMMEs
,
farming
etc.
.
This
cluster
would
advise
the
municipality
on
local
economic
development
and
IDP
issues
.
The
stakeholder
cluster
system
would
complement
the
existing
participatory
mechanisms
within
municipalities
;
deepen
participatory
democracy
and
increase
the
amount
of
people
who
have
influence
on
and
take
ownership
of
municipal
decisions
.
<LINE# 1618>
Encouraging
strong
leadership
throughout
society
to

<LINE# 1840>
In
a
developmental
state
,
unions
share
responsibility
for
the
quality
of
services
delivered
,
for
improving
the
performance
of
government
,
and
for
fighting
corruption
and
inefficiency
.
<LINE# 1412>
All
the
information
listed
under
Method
is
placed
on
the
wall
for
all
members
of
the
group
to
view
.
The
facilitator
for
the
meeting
goes
through
the
information
and
invites
additional
input
from
the
group
.
As
this
meeting
is
to
prioritise
the
outcomes
that
will
form
the
ward
plan
the
group
needs
to
come
to
an
agreement
as
to
what
these
priorities
will
be
.
<LINE# 1855>
It
needs
to
be
clear
when
parties
outside
government
are
responsible
for
implementing
parts
of
the
plan
.
Business
,
labour
and
civil
society
are
diverse
groupings
and
rarely
speak
with
a
common
voice
.
Nevertheless
,
clear
responsibilities
and
accountability
chains
,
including
with
social
partners
,
are
essential
for
the
success
of
the
plan
.
In
many
areas
,
business
,
labour
and
civil
society
can
identify
how
they
can
contribute
to
the
plan
’s
priorities
.
However
,
in
some
cases
this
role
will
need
to
be
formalised
.
Working
together
to
realise
particular
objectives
in
the
plan
will
help
to
build
trust
both
within
and
between
sectors
.
<LINE# 1042>
Community
-
based
planning
is
therefore
a
form
of
participatory
planning
designed
to
promote
community
action
and
to
link
to
the
Integrated
Development
Plan
(
IDP
)
.
<LINE# 2111>
QUESTION
4
What
are
key
result
areas
(
KRAs
)
?
<LINE# 1843>
Because
the
plan
is
designed
to
bring
about
fundamental
change
over
a
period
of
nearly
two
decades
,
it
requires
a
degree
of
policy
consistency
that
straddles
changes
in
leadership
in
government
,
business
and
labour
.
Many
aspects
of
the
plan
will
require
years
of
effort
to
deliver
results
.
For
example
,
the
transition
to
a
low
-
carbon
economy
will
need
long
-
term
policies
and
spatial
planning
regulations
will
take
decades
to
overcome
the
geographic
divisions
of
apartheid
.
Policy
changes
should
be
approached
cautiously
based
on
experience
and
evidence
so
that
the
country
does
not
lose
sight
of
its
long
-
term
objectives
.
<LINE# 0785>
The
elected
council
is
the
ultimate
decision
-
making
forum
on
IDPs
.
The
role
of
participatory
democracy
is
to
inform
,
negotiate
and
comment
on
those
decisions
,
in
the
course
of
the
planning
/
decision
-
making
process
.

that
were

The
extent
to
which

are

must
also
be
noted
.

<LINE# 2167>
Participation
in
the
Integrated
Development
Plan
Forum
–
encourage
participation
in
the
forum
either
directly
or
through
representation
of
the
Ward
Committee
if
other
municipal
-
wide
structures
for
participation
do
not
exist
.
<LINE# 1782>
Research
and
development
(
R&D
)
.
A
simultaneous
focus
on
R&D
and
on
the
calibre
of
teaching
would
improve
the
quality
of
higher
education
,
but
without
attention
,
inadequate
human
capacity
will
constrain
knowledge
production
and
innovation
.
Universities
need
to
become
centres
of
excellence
at
the
cutting
edge
of
technology
.
By
attracting
students
from
abroad
,
universities
can
generate
revenue
and
increase
the
skills
pool
.
Students
from
abroad
who
graduate
from
South
African
universities
should
qualify
for
a
seven
-
year
work
permit
to
encourage
them
to
stay
and
work
here
.
While
South
Africa
needs
to
spend
more
on
R&D
in
general
,
the
institutional
setup
also
needs
to
improve
the
link
between
innovation
and
business
requirements
.
Government
should
partner
with
the
private
sector
to
raise
the
level
of
R&D
,
with
resources
targeted
towards
building
the
research
infrastructure
required
by
a
modern
economy
.
<LINE# 1838>
South
Africa
has
a
well
-
developed
and
vibrant
trade
-
union
movement
.
Historically
,
trade
unions
have
played
a
role
in
politics
,
understanding
that
the
issues
pertinent
to
its
members
do
not
stop
at
the
factory
gate
.
Unions
advance
the
interests
of
their
members
and
give
voice
to
vulnerable
workers
,
such
as
farm
workers
,
domestic
workers
or
casual
workers
.
The
rights
and
benefits
afforded
to
workers
and
increases
in
living
standards
that
most
workers
have
seen
since
1994
constitute
a
significant
gain
for
the
country
.

<LINE# 1234>
Once
a
plan
is
drawn
up
identifying
what
the
community
needs
,
an
action
plan
of
the
immediate
activities
must
be
developed
so
that
the
community
can
take
their
own
development
process
forward
.
This
may
involve
allocating
discretionary
funds
that
are
already
available
,
actions
the
community
has
to
take
to
get
other
projects
moving
,
as
well
as
purely
local
activities
such
as
organising
a
festival
,
litter
-
picking
event
etc.
.
<LINE# 1244>
The
CBP
process
should
occur
prior
to
the
initial
steps
of
the
IDP
planning
and
review
process
so
as
to
inform
the
IDP
in
each
municipal
area
.
The
planning
needs
to
be
specified
and
detailed
in
each
municipality
.
In
the

of
a
schedule
for
undertaking
CBP
as
part
of
the
planning
cycle
,
the

The

team
should
take
care
to
update
any
new
information
that
is
revealed
and
make
corrections
so
that
the
information
included
in
the

is
that
which
has
been
validated
by
the
broader
community
group
.
<LINE# 2388>
People
,
communities
,
sectors
and
groups
are
different
with
differing
interests
and
priorities
.
These
factors
contribute
to
a
dynamic
and
creative
community
.
Ward
Committees
need
to
feel
confident
and
have
the
skill
to
handle
these
different
ideas
to
the
benefit
of
the

.

As

CONFLICT
IS
PART
OF
EVERYDAY
LIFE
.
It
occurs
at
the
simplest
level
,
that
is
a
decision
as
to
what
clothing
to
put
on
,
or
what
takes
priority
in
planning
your

a
personal
quarrel
with
a
relative
,
friend
or
colleague
to
international
disputes
,
political
altercations
or
a
battle
over
,
which
can
result
in
violence
and
even
death
.
As
Ward
Committees
interact
with
people
with
different
needs
and
expectations
as
well
as
municipalities
with
varying
available
resources
,
conflict
is
likely
to
occur
.
Ward
Committees
need
to
be
able
to
respond
to
conflict
in
a
constructive
way
.
This

the
types
of
conflict
that
can
arise
that
Ward

may
need
to

the
critical
capabilities

Achieving
these

nor
will
they
emerge
if
the
country
continues
on
its
present

.
Rising
levels
of
frustration
and
impatience
suggest
that
time
is
of
the
essence
:
failure
to
act
will
threaten
democratic
gains

The
rights
-
based
approach
–
this
is
when
a
party
to
a
conflict
believes
that
one
of
its
rights
has
been
infringed
and
approaches
a
structure
for
a
decision
on
the
alleged
infringement
.
The
mechanisms
include
courts
,
litigation
and
arbitration
.
For
example
,
the
residents
of
Moutse
challenged
the
cross
boundary
border
judgement
transferring
Moutse

South
Africa
needs
to
sharpen
its
innovative
edge

,
and
more
nimble
institutions
that
facilitate
innovation
and

The

To
this

,
the

need
to
be

Further

(
FET
)
.
The
FET
system
is
not
effective
.
It
is
too
small
and
the
output
quality
is
poor
.
Continuous
quality
improvement
is
needed
as
the
system
expands
.
The
quality
and
relevance
of
courses
needs
urgent
attention
.
When
quality
starts
to
improve
and
the
employability
of
graduates
begins
to
increase
,
demand
for
FET
services
will
rise
automatically
.
Simply
growing
the
sector
without
focusing
on
quality
is
likely
to
be
expensive
and
demoralising
for
young
people
,
further
stigmatising
the
system
.
By
2030
,
the
FET
sector
should
cover
about
25
percent
of
the
age
-
relevant
cohort
,
implying
an
increase
from
about
300
000
today
to
1.25

by

The
WID
approach
has
tended
to
view
women
as
passive
recipients

,
rather
than
as
active
agents
in
transforming
or
changing
their
own
economic
,
social
,
political

realities
.
A
key
outcome
has
been
that
women

concerns
were
viewed
in
isolation
as
separate
issues
,
leading
to
their
marginalisation

the

The
output

Diversity
within
an
organisation
or
a
community
embraces
the
differences
between
men
,
women
,
cultures
and
races
in
order
to
foster
tolerance
of
the
differences
,
so
that
this
diversity
can
embrace
these
differences
.
This
is
a
striving
towards
harmonious
interaction
,
so
that
the
organisation
or
community
can
move
towards
synergy
and
the
operation
of
their
ultimate
objectives

A

will
need
to
be
found
to
provide
the
stipends
for
the

,
and
cover
the

The
funder
will
also

A
schedule
is
a
useful
tool
that
will
assist
the
facilitator
/
s
to
plan
the
steps
that
will
be
undertaken
to
achieve
the
ward
plan
.
The
CBP
schedule
may
differ
depending
on
the
community
that
the
facilitator
is
working
with
.
For
example
,
in
a
commercial
farming
area
it
may
be
necessary
to
have
more
activities
in
the
evening
that
involve
the
community
,
but
schedule
meetings
with
the
Ward
Committee
during
the
day
.
In
a
community
where
most
of
the
residents
are
professionals
or
in
business
it
may
be
difficult
to
get
participation
from
the
community
due
to
work
pressures
.
Facilitators
may
need
to
plan
for
only
one
or
two
evenings
to
bring
residents
together
and
do
other
planning
during
the
day
.
The
length
of
time
required
for
planning
can
be
reduced
if
a
situational
analysis
has
been
completed
or
partially
completed
as
this
can
save
time
on
this
aspect
.

.
The

is
made
up

they
can
be
co-opted

of
Municipal
Ward
Committees

2005
–
the
Guidelines
explain
the
Ward
Committee
is
independent
,
an
advisory
body
and
must
be
impartial
in
carrying
out
its
functions
without
fear
,
favour
or

and
the
important

that
the

<LINE# 1598>
At
present
the
role
of
traditional
leadership
in
the
new
local
government
system
is
not
clearly
defined
.
Traditional
structures
are
still
very
important
in
rural
areas
.
For
example
,
in
KwaZulu
-
Natal
the
local
traditional
authority
played
a
prominent
role
in
the
Isulabasha
/
Mvunyane
water
and
sanitation
project
,
and
the
Maluti
District
Planning
Committee
.
Although
the
roles
and
functions
of
traditional
authorities
is
still
unclear
,
they
must
play
a
role
in
CBP
in
rural
areas
.
They
serve
both
as
an
agent
for
change
and
an
important
entry
point
into
the
community
as
they
command
a
lot
of
respect
in
the
community
and
are
able
to
engage
or
influence
people
.
<LINE# 0311>
DIVERSITY
IS
LIKE
A
MOSAIC
:
all
people
who
make
up
an

are

;
they
are
all
different
but
fit
together
as

.
<LINE# 1820>
The
efficacy
of
the
intergovernmental
system
is
a
hotly
debated
subject
.
The
different
spheres
of
government
are
interdependent
and
we
need
to
find
ways
of
ensuring
they
work
together
more
effectively
.
The
plan
proposes
a
change
of
approach
away
from
trying
to
find
new
structural
arrangements
,
which
is
destabilising
,
towards
identifying
and
resolving
specific
weaknesses
in
coordination
and
capacity
.
The
state
needs
to
improve
its
management
of
the
system
,
including
mediating
agreements
between
district
and
local
municipalities
where
there
is
duplication
or
conflict
over
the
allocation
of
responsibilities
and
resources
.
Provinces
should
focus
on
their
core
functions
and
develop
their
capacity
to
support
and
oversee
local
government
.

In

A
good
way
to
start
is
to
invite
the
oldest
person
in
the
group
to
share
the
earliest
event
they
can
remember
.
Use
that
event
as
the
starting
point
of
the
timeline
.
Start
by
drawing
a
timeline
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
put
it
on
the
wall
.
It
is
helpful
to
get
people
to
write
events
onto
cards
and
then
put
the
cards
on
the
timeline
.
If
writing
is
a
problem
the
facilitator
can
record
the
events
on
the
timeline
for
the
participants
of
the
group
.
The
timeline
should
remain
displayed
for
additions
and
as
a

to
assist

.
<LINE# 1852>
A
recurring
theme
in
the
plan
is
that
the
accountability
chain
needs
to
be
tightened
.
The
public
needs
a
clearer
sense
of
who
is
accountable
for

.
There
need
to
be
systems
to
hold
all
leaders
in

accountable
for
their
conduct
.
<LINE# 2150>
In
plenary
ask
one
member
from
each

to
answer
one
of
the
questions
,
if
you
have

the

<LINE# 2380>
Ward
Committees
represent
diverse
interests
and
groups
.
For
example
,
some
members
may
represent
a
group
of
ratepayers
,
others
a
women
’s
group
,
others
development
organisations
and
others
business
associations
.
At
the
same
time
Ward
Committees
need
to
work
together
to
ensure
that
the
views
of
the
community
have
a
platform
for
expression
and
that
their
views
are
taken
into
account
in
a
way
that
benefits
the
community
.
It
may
not
be
possible
to
respond
to
all
the
needs
,
but
insofar
as
possible
Ward
Committees
need
to
seek
the
most
appropriate
and
beneficial
outcome
for
the
community
.
Ward
Committees
may
also
find
themselves
in
other
potential
conflict
situations
with
a
range
of
local
government
stakeholders
that
they
work
with
,
and
having
the
necessary
skills
to
diffuse
or
reduce
or
resolve
conflict
will
assist
them
in
carrying
out
their
duties
.
<LINE# 0992>
The

exercising
their
responsibilities
,
contributing
to

<LINE# 0962>
A
number
of
municipalities
have
formulated
policies
,
or
their
own
regulatory
frameworks
,
for
Ward
Committees
in
their
municipality
.
The
policies
regulate
the
establishment
,
operations
and
functioning
of
Ward
Committees
in
their
municipality
and
provide
a
clear
outline
of
the
systems
and
procedures
that
will
help
Ward
Committees
to
operate
successfully
.
The
policies
must
be
adapted
because
each

is
different
and
should
try
and
put
in

policies
that
are
most

LOCAL

IS
REGARDED
AS
the
sphere
of
government
closest
to
the
people

Involving
the
community
in
identifying
needs
and
in
designing
policies
and
programmes
is
an
effective
way
of
responding
to
the
needs
of
the
community
.
As
it
is
not
possible
for
every
citizen
to
be
directly
involved
,
Ward
Committees
are
in
place
as
a
structure
through
which
to
channel
this
communication

However
,
communication
processes
need
to
take

and
implementation
process

They
have
an
agenda
–
the

and
the

,
this
includes
not
giving
instructions

<LINE# 1894>
Ward

members
are
most
effective
if
they
are
allocated
portfolios
according
to
the
structures
or
sectors
in
which
they
are
already
active
.
For
example
,
the

may
be
given
the
portfolio
on
Agriculture
,
or
a
Ward

member
who
is

may
work
on
the
Education
portfolio
.
This
is
not

The
purpose
of
the
IDP
is
to
ensure
that
the
resources
available
to
the
municipality
are
directed
at
delivery
of
projects
and
programmes
to
meet
agreed
development
priorities
.
An
IDP
is
an
important
tool
that
ensures
that
the

identified
and
carried
out
by

are
related
to
the

incentivise
the
entry
of
young
people
into
the
labour
market
,
while
taking
due
care
to
prevent
substitution
or
the
diminution
of
existing
working
conditions
.
Some
work
opportunities
may
not
enable
individuals
to
immediately
live
the
lives
that
they
desire
.
To
promote
sustainable
livelihoods
,
it
is
important
that
individuals
or
families
,
irrespective
of
income
,
can
access
services
such
as
quality
education
,
health
care
or
public
transport
.
It
is
also
important
for
a
person
who
loses
their
job
to
be
able
to
access
work
from
public
works
programmes
or
community
-
based
employment
schemes

In
these
ways
,
public

complements
individual
effort

should
test
the

decide
whether

not

them
;
encourage

Long
-
term
shifts
in
global
trade
and
investment
are
reshaping
the
world
economy
and
international
politics
.
Chief
among
these
developments
is
the
emergence
of
rapidly
growing
economies
,
particularly
China
,
India
and
Brazil
.
After
nearly
three
centuries
of
divergence
,
inequality
between
nations
is
decreasing
.
Urbanisation
and
industrialisation
in
China
and
India
are
likely
to
keep
demand
for
natural
resources
relatively
high
for
a
decade
or
more
.
The
emergence
of
more
consumers
in
developing
countries
will
broaden
opportunities
for
all
economies
.
<LINE# 1670>
The
struggle
against
apartheid
was
first
and
foremost
about
the
construction
of
a
non-racial
and
non-sexist
democratic
society
,
in
which
all
people
have
equal
rights
.
Despite
consistent
progress
since
1994
,
South
Africa
remains
a
divided
society
,
with
race
still
forming
the
main
divide
.
Individual
stereotyping
of
race
and
ethnicity
is
widespread
and
discrimination
persists
.
The
country
’s
institutional
framework
and
its
broad
economic
and
social
trends
have
contributed
to
gradual
deracialisation
,
but
progress
is
not
sufficient
or
deep
enough
.
Although
progress
has
been
made
to
improve
the
lives
of
women
;
discrimination
,
patriarchal
attitudes
and
poor
access
to
quality
education
persists
.
The
plan
deals
with
these
factors
holistically
,
recognising
that
key
priorities
such
as
education
or
rural
development
will
have
the
biggest
impact
on
poor
women
.
<LINE# 1847>
The
National
Development
Plan
will
shape
resource
allocations
over
the
next
two
decades
,
but
it
will
not
determine
annual
budgets
.
The
best
way
to
generate
resources
to
implement
the
plan
is
to
grow
the
economy
faster
.
If
the
economy
grows
by
more
than
5
percent
a
year
,
government
revenue
and
the
profits
of
private
firms
will
more
than
double
over
the
next
20
years

Citizen
participation
also
helps
to
make
sure
that
government
is
accountable
and
delivers
on
its
mandate
.
Being
citizens
does
not
end
with
electing
public
officials
.
Public
officials
also
can
not
be
expected
to
make
the
best
decisions
for
citizens
if
citizens
do
not
keep
them
informed
about
their
needs
.
Citizens
know
best
what
they
need
and
it
is
important
that
they
take
part
in
creating
solutions
to
these
needs
.
Citizens
need
to
work
in
partnership
with
government
to
assist

development
.
This

Ward
Committees

a

South
Africa
can
benefit
from
rapid
growth
in
developing
countries
that
leads
to
increased
demand
for
commodities
and
expanding
consumer
markets
.
At
the
same
time
,
these
trends
pose
challenges
for
middle
-
income
countries
as
a
result
of
greater
competition
in
manufacturing
and
certain
information
technology
-
enabled
services
.
The
rise
of
emerging
markets
also
increases
international
competition
,
placing
downward
pressure
on
the
wages
of
low
-
skilled
workers
in
tradable
sectors
.
<LINE# 1737>
The
electricity
crisis
of
2008
and
other
recent
developments
have
exposed
institutional
weaknesses
related
to
state
-
owned
companies
responsible
for
network
infrastructure
.
Averting
such
problems
requires
clear
institutional
arrangements
,
transparent
shareholder
compacts
,
clean
lines
of
accountability
and
sound
financial
models
to
ensure
sustainability
.
We
make
recommendations
in
each
of
these
areas
.
Laws
that
govern
regulation
are
often
confusing
,
conflating
policy
with
regulation
.
We
propose
ways
to
fix
this
.
<LINE# 2351>
Scarcity
of
resources
–
for
example
,
the
scenario
outlined
above
.
Because
of
the
lack
of
an
adequate
water
supply
a
tap
was
installed
that
inconvenienced
everyone
.
Or
for
example
,
there
is
a
shortage
of
housing
and
a
conflict
can
arise
about
housing
allocation
and
the
criteria
that
are
applied
when
allocating

South

market
is
often
characterised
by
contestation
between
profitable

reasonably
well

,
particularly
among

,
extraordinary
measures
will
be
required
.
Union

critical
to

Service
standards
inform

expect
,
they
define
how

.
As
such

service
standards
are
an
integral

should
ensure
that
service
standards
set

even
where

may
involve
an
element
of

,
are
nevertheless
embedded
in
structures
of
gender

which
generally
ascribe
lower

A

has
a

than
being
an

Accountability

Ward

Monitoring

regularly
reporting
back

a
useful
way
of

.
Accurately
communicating
the

and
between
all

is
key
.
Misinformation
can
lead
to

.
It
can
encourage
the

of

The

much

was
an

South

’s
principal
challenge
is
to
roll
back
poverty

inequality
.
Raising
living
standards
to
the
minimum
level
proposed

will
involve
a
combination
of
increasing
employment
,
higher
incomes
through

,
a

wage
[

and
good

quality
public
services
.
All
of
these
challenges
are
interlinked
.
Improved
education
,
for
example
,
will
lead
to
higher
employment
and
earnings
,
while

The
Commission
’s
view
is
that
in
the
long
term
,
users
must
pay
the
bulk
of
the
costs
for
economic
infrastructure
,
with
due
protection
for
poor
households
.
The
role
of
government
and
the
fiscus
is
to
provide
the
requisite
guarantees
so
that
the
costs
can
be
amortised
over
time
,
thereby
smoothing
the
price
path
.
The
state
must
also
put
in
place
appropriate
regulatory
and
governance
frameworks
so
that
the
infrastructure
is
operated
efficiently
and
tariffs
can
be
set
at
appropriate
levels
.
For
infrastructure
that
generates
financial
returns
,
debt
raised
to
build
facilities
should
be
on
the
balance
sheets
of
state
-
owned
enterprises
or
private
companies
that
do
the
work
.
Guarantees
should
be
used
selectively
to
lower
the
cost
of
capital
and
to
secure
long
-
term
finance
.
Subsidies
to
poor
households
should
be
as
direct
and
as
transparent
as
possible
.
Social
infrastructure
that
does
not
generate
financial
returns
–
such
as
schools
or
hospitals
–
should
be
financed
from
the
budget
.

must
develop

for

can
,
if
it

establish

<LINE# 0398>
Equality
is
concerned
with
treating
individuals
in
the
same
way
,
regardless
of
outcomes
.
It
refers
to
the
same
treatment
in
dealings
,
quantities
or
values
.
Equality
can
lead
to
serious
inequalities
for
groups
that
have
been
disadvantaged
by
a
system
that
fails
to
take
their
situations
and
perspectives
into

Equal

Section
2.3.2
of
the
White
Paper
1998
states
that
the
promotion
of
local
democracy
should
be
seen
as
a
central
role
for
any
municipal
government
.
It
outlines
four
principles
for
participation
,
which
includes
allowing
citizens
,
either
as
individuals
or
interest
groups
,
to
have
input
into
local
politics
and
service
consumers
to
have
a
say
in
the
way
services
are
delivered
.
The
local
sphere
is
an
arena
where
citizens
can
participate
in
decision
-
making
to
shape
their
own
living
environments
,
and
exercise
and
extend
their
democratic
rights
.
All
supporting
legislation
has
been
written
with
this
in
mind
.
This
means
that
Ward
Committee
members
need
to
keep
these
ideas
in
mind
when
thinking
about
how
they
fulfil
their
role
as
a
communication
channel
between
the
council
and
citizens
in
their
community
.
<LINE# 1589>
The
success
of
the
process
is
hinged
upon
a
high
level
of
participation
from
ward
members
in
ward
planning
.
This
will
enable
the
community
to
conduct
its
own
planning
processes
in
the
future
,
reducing
reliance
on
outside
facilitators
.
<LINE# 1889>

Manipulation
–
The
local
council
or
an
organisation
‘
pretends
’
to
consult
to
legitimise
a
process
without
real
consultation
taking
place
.
For
example
an
organisation
or
company
or
council
says
we
have
consulted
and
the
community
agrees
when
what
has
taken
place
is
that
people
have
been
told
that
an
event
is
taking
place
.
<LINE# 1639>
Today
the
labour
force
(
those
aged
15

)
makes
up
64
percent
of
the

,
with
the
proportion
of
children
and
the
elderly
comprising
smaller
shares
.
Internationally
,
demographic
profiles
such
as
these
are
often
associated
with
rising
incomes
,
faster
productivity
growth
,
higher
savings
and
rising
living

.
Alternatively
,
they
can
lead
to
a
frustrating

destabilising
environment
where
young
people
can
not
get
work
,
contributing
to
violence
,
crime
,
alcohol
abuse
and
other
social
ills
.
The
determinant
of
success
is
whether
a
country
can
harness
the
advantage
of
having
a
large
number
of
young
people
who
are
able
and
willing
to
work
.
To
do
so
means
providing
them
with
education
and
skills
,
and
helping
school
leavers
find
work
that
is
stimulating
and
through
which
they
can

trade
informally

<LINE# 1832>
To
successfully
implement
this
plan
,
the
country
needs
partnerships
across
society
working
together
towards
a
common
purpose
.
At
present
,
South
Africa
has
high
levels
of
mistrust
between
major
social
partners
.
A
virtuous
cycle
of
building
trust
and
engaging

to
confront
the
most
pressing
challenges
is
needed
–
one
that
takes

want
the
IDP
to
include
provision
for
upgrading
the
current
taxi

.
A
third
group
wants
to
increase
the
refuse
service
to
two
days
a

in
the
city
area
due
to
the
amount
of
refuse

Really
listening
is
one
of
the
most
important
aspects
of
communication
.
People
need
to
feel
that
they
have
been
heard
and
understood
.
This
requires
listening
with
empathy
.
Empathetic
listening
means
you
see
the
world
through
the
other
person
’s
eyes
.
It
involves
listening
with
full
concentration
and

Explain
that
drawing
up
a

is
an
important

of
developing
a

as
the

is
the
‘

It

at
where
the

Explain
that
this

takes
time

when
working

the

sufficient

must
be
given
to
do
so
.

that
these

that
the

is
made
up
of

On
the

by

The

can
vary
depending

Ward

a
skill
fundamental

it

the

For

What
is

hearing
?
<LINE# 0473>
Understanding
gender
and
applying
a
basic
gender
analysis
are
essential
tools
for
Ward
Committees
in
terms
of
development
.
You
do
not
have
to
be
a
gender
activist
who
wants
to
work
for
the
emancipation
and
equality
of
women
to
use
a
gender
analysis
.
Everyone
working
in
the
area
of
community
development
who
wants
to
improve
the
lives
of
people
should
know
how
to
use
these
tools
.
Given
that
women
,
particularly
in
the
age
group
of
15
to
24
,
have
extremely
high
prevalence
of
HIV
and
AIDS
,
special
attention
needs
to
be
given
to
ensuring
that
the
programmes
and
projects
identified
by
the
community
take
this
into
account
.
<LINE# 1459>
Concept

whether
it
is
worth
considering
.
<LINE# 2120>
Once
it
has
been
established
which
services
are
to
be
expanded
or
improved
clear
timeframes
and
targets
must
be
developed
that
the
municipality
can
decide
the
best
ways
to
reach
its
goals
.
It
must
also
decide
what
resources
–
financial
,
equipment
,
and

–
it
will
require
to
meet
its
goals
.

A
Ward
Committee
may
conduct
an
annual
satisfaction
survey
in

be
administered
in

Employment
scenarios
prepared
by
the
Commission
suggest
that
most
new

are
likely
to
be
sourced
in
domestic
-
orientated
businesses
,
and
in
growing
small
-
and
medium
-
sized
firms
.
While
most
jobs
are
not
created
directly
in
exporting
firms
,
the
sectors
that
are
globally
traded
tend
to
have
more
potential
to
stimulate
domestic
spin

offs
.
Given
South
Africa
’s
low
savings
rate
and
the
need
to
invest
at
a
higher
rate
,
it
is
important
to
grow
exports

expand

in
those
sectors
.
South
Africa
’s
trade
profile
has
not
fulfilled
either
of
these

Making
progress
will

The

Seymour
ended
in
the
late

.
The
entire
district
was
zoned
for
inclusion
in
the
Ciskei
homeland
.
Property
and
buildings
in
the
district
were
transferred
to
state
control
,
and
this
led
to
the
collapse
of
the
economy
of
the
area
.
Most
of
the
farmers
moved
away
from
the
area
.
The
majority
of
the
population
(
predominantly

lost
their
jobs
,
and
they
had
no

There
is
an
active
Ward
Committee
in
your
community
.
Meetings
are
generally
held
at
6
pm
on
weekday
nights
.
Because
women
are
traditionally
expected
to
see
to
children
and
have
meals
ready
for
families
by
that
time
,
many
women
are
unable
to
attend
.
Some
women
also
worry
about
walking
or
catching
taxis
home
after
dark
.
Some
others
also
complain
that
when
they
do
manage
to
get
to
the
meetings
their
issues
and
grievances
are
not
taken
seriously
.
Yet
others
say
they
face
angry
and
abusive
male
partners
for
even
attending
meetings
and
not
being
at
home
.
Now

over

is
taking

They
want
to
start
their
own

a
result
of
this
.
The
men
oppose
this
development
,
saying
that
women
have
no
need
to
meet
on
their
own
as
men
are
quite
capable
of
taking
up
all
community
issues
.
<LINE# 0783>
Citizen
participation
also
helps
to
make
sure
that
government
is
accountable
and
delivers
on
its
mandate
.
Being
citizens
does
not
end
with
electing
public
officials
.
Public
officials
also
can
not
be
expected
to
make
the
best
decisions
for
citizens
if
citizens
do
not
keep
them
informed
about
their
needs
.
Citizens
know
best
what
they
need
and
it
is
important
that
they
take

in
creating
solutions
to
these
needs
.
Citizens

the
most
challenging
part
of
the

as
it

,
prioritising
the
suggestions
and
finding
an
agreement

to
use
a

of
techniques
to
get
the

to
the
point
that

This

For

made
.
The

The

South
Africa
’s
experience
of
globalisation
includes
tangible
benefits
and
increased
complexity
.
The
challenge
is
to
take
advantage
of
opportunities
while
protecting
South
Africans
–
especially
the
poor
–
from
the
risks
associated
with
new
trade
and
investment
patterns
.
For
example
,
South
Africa
has
a
low
level
of
savings
and
relies
on
foreign
capital
to
finance
its
investments
.
Dependence
on
external
capital
flows
increases
the
risk
of
volatility
in
the
domestic
economy
.
Slower
growth
in
developed
countries
has
been
accompanied
by
strong
demand
from
developing
countries
,
contributing
to
a
welcome
rebalancing
of
the
country
’s
exports
.
Yet
this
trend
also
poses
a
challenge
for
policy
makers
and
manufacturers
,
because
present
demand
from
emerging
markets
is
weighted
towards
commodities
and
raw
materials
,
rather
than
a
more
diversified
basket
of
products
required
by
developed
countries
.
<LINE# 1711>
A
contentious
issue
is
whether
South
Africa
can
mobilise
unemployed
people
into
production
for
export
markets
.
Some
argue
that
the
economy
is
not
competitive
in
labour
-
intensive
manufacturing
because
the
cost
structure
is
too
high
,
the
exchange
rate
is
too
volatile
,
infrastructure
is
inadequate
and
the
skills
base
is
too
limited
.
Yet
South
Africa
could
compete
in
a
range
of
categories
should
these
concerns
be
addressed
–
and
in
large
part
,
they
can
be
addressed
.
Exchange
-
rate
volatility
creates
a
barrier
to
success
and
the
plan
proposes
that
resolving
domestic
resource
costs
and
skills
availability
would
have
a
more
sustained
impact
on
costs
.
As
a
middle
-
income
country
,
South
Africa
has
to
compete
on
the
basis
of
excellent
products
and
brands
,
and
effective
entry
into
global
distribution
channels
.
This
will
require
greater
commitment
to
research
and
development
and
its
commercialisation
,
an
efficient
logistics
platform
and
effective
economic
diplomacy

Despite
healthy
balance
sheets
,
many
South
African
corporations
are
not
investing
because
the

economy
remains
weak

Businesses
are
also
concerned
about
changes
in
the
policy
and
regulatory
environment
that
may
raise
costs
.
To
some
extent
,
low
investment
is
also
the
result
of
inadequate
infrastructure
provided
by
state

South

IN
ORDER
TO
ENSURE
SUSTAINABLE
DEVELOPMENT
,
it
is
necessary
to
recognise
the
importance
of
the
two
sexes
as
complementary
biological
entities
.
It
is
also
important
to
respect
full
equity
and
equality
of
the
social
roles
that
men
and
women
assume
in
their
lives
.
The
way
in
which
men
and
women
are
perceived
and
treated
in
a
society
is
one
of
the
cornerstones
of
any
political
,
social
and
economic
system
.
At
the
same
time
the
way
it
is
applied
is
also
one
of
its
most
revealing
facets
.
This

the
advantages
of
incorporating
the
principles
of
gender

equity

Local
Government
,
1998
is
a
policy
document
that
establishes
the
basis
for
a
new

system
.
This
new

is
committed
to
working
with
citizens
,

and
communities
to
provide
for
a
quality
of
life
and
meet
the
social
,
economic
and
material
needs
of
the
communities
.
This
means
that
municipalities
need
to
structure

their
administration

processes
to

basic
needs
of

Community

Municipal
management

a
wide

As

it
needs
to
be
managed
in
a

that
the

However
communities

It
is
also
in
the
interests
of
business
that
the
level
of

be
reduced

Inequality
raises
the
cost
of
doing
business
,
skews
market

and
ultimately
limits
growth
opportunities
.
It
also
breeds
mistrust

does
little

that
the

make
it
easier

In

consultants
played

often

problematic

IDP
consultants
as

as
municipal

tend
to
be
engineers

town
planners
,
and
are
therefore
trained
to
focus
on
physical

infrastructural
or
spatial
issues
,
rather
than
process
dynamics
or
community
consultation
.
This
problem
was
widely
recognised
by

the

conducted

Political
will
is
essential
to
combat
this
scourge
.
Political
will
is
measured
by
assessing
the
amount
of
money
spent
fighting
corruption
,
the
legal
arsenal
that
corruption
-
busting
institutions
have
at
their
disposal
,
the
independence
of
anti-corruption
authorities
from
political
interference
and
the
consistency
with
which
the
law
is
applied
.
Being
soft
on
smaller
cases
,
or
unusually
tough
on
corruption
involving
political
opponents
,
implies
inconsistency

If

we

‘

Living

respond
to

positively

As

Technical
advisors
can
and
do
play
an
important
role
as
they
provide
skills
and
expertise
that
the
community
may
not
have
,
therefore
it
may
be
important
to
bring
in
technical
advisors
/
service
providers
from
higher
levels
of
local
government
,
NGOs
or
the
private
sector
.
The
participation
of
technical
advisors
should
assist
the
process
by
providing
appropriate
inputs
to
the
process
,
without
dictating
the
outcomes
.
For
example
the
involvement
of
technical

is
useful
when

are
selecting
strategies
and

to
achieve
their
objectives
,
i.e.
around

Some

about
twice

illustrates
the

A
service
contract
is
an
agreement
between
a
municipality
and
a
service
provider
to
provide
a
particular
aspect
of
a
municipal
service
on
a
short

term
basis
(
only
one
or
two
years
)
.
The
municipality
provides
the
budget
and
monitors
the
performance
of
the
service
provider
to
ensure
that
the
service
provided
is
of
a
good

within
the

A
plan
is
only
as
credible
as
its
delivery
mechanism
is
viable
.
There
is
a
real
risk
that
South
Africa
’s
developmental

could
fail
because
the
state
is
incapable
of
implementing
it
.
The

makes
far
-
reaching
institutional
reform
proposals
to
remedy
the
uneven
and
often
poor
performance
of
the
public
service
and
local
government
.
<LINE# 1444>
In
the
first
part
of
Phase
4
CBP
participants
are
given
practical
guidelines
about
proposals
for
submission
to
the
IDP
and
project

for
projects
that
require
external

.
The
development
of
a
discretionary
ward
fund
budget
enabling
the
community
to
move
forward
with
their
plan
immediately
is
also
discussed
.
The
second
part
of
Phase
4
emphasises
that
a
detailed
action
plan
is
essential
in
making
the
plan
a
reality
.
It
outlines
how
projects
need
to
be
broken
down
into
a
step
by
step
plan
of
action
explaining
how
to
go
about
documenting
the

.
The
phase
concludes
with
the
submission
of
the
finalised
plan
to
the

manager
for
approval
of
the
discretionary

budget
.
Once
this

There
are
many
different
types
of
project
management
used
in
the
development
sector
.
These
often
differ
from
models
used
in
the
corporate
world
.
They
also
tend
to
differ
between
countries
.
In
the
South
African
context
there
is
not
a
standardised
public
sector
model
and
there
will
be
differences
even
between
the
models
used
in
different
government
departments
.
Ward
Committee
members
should
be
familiar
with
project

management
as
this
is
the
model
most

The
break

Yet
over

improving

The
starting
point
for
any
type
of
conflict
is
to
identify
what
conflict
is
.
Conflict
is
not
necessarily
negative
.
In
fact
conflict
can
act
as
a
catalyst
for
change
or
transformation
.
The
word
conflict
is
derived
from
the
Latin
‘
conflictus
’
meaning
‘
to
strike
together
’
.
For
example
,
if
you
strike
two
matches
together
you
are
able
to
light
a
fire
with
which
to
cook
or
keep
warm
.
The
way
in
which
we
respond
to
conflict
will
often
determine
whether
the
conflict
escalates
,
that
is
gets
worse
,
or
de-escalates
,
that
is
minimises
the
conflict
.
Many
conflicts
may
not
be
resolved
,
but
addressing
the
needs
of
the
people
involved
will
assist
in
diffusing
the
situation
.

A
community
living
in
a
shack
settlement
near
the
city
centre
has
been
relocated
to
a
new
housing
development
20
km
from
the
city
centre
.
One
of
the
reasons
circulating
in
the
shack
settlement
for
moving
is
because
some
of
the
shack
dwellers
have
been
allocated
permanent
homes
which
they
have
been
renting
out
.
Many
residents
are
angry
as
they
have
been
on
the
housing
waiting
list
for
a
long
time
and
they
say
that
it
is
unfair
for
those
residents
who
have
been
allocated
homes
to
rent
them
out
because
this
is
preventing
other
residents
from
getting
homes
.
At
the
same
time
they
say
that
they
do
not
want
to
move
as
it
is
too
far
from
town
and
most
of
them
work
in
the
city
and
do
not
have
money
for
transport
.
The
residents
say
that
they
will
not
move
.
In
an
interview
with
the

the
chairperson
of
the
residents
’
committee
said
that
if
they
had
been
consulted
before
these
plans
were
made
they
would
have
been
able
to
explain
why
they
did
not
move
and
that
the
reason
for
some
of
the
residents
,
who
have
been
allocated
homes
,
are
renting
their
homes
is
because
it
is
too
expensive
for
them
to
travel

Equity
is
concerned
with
equality
of
outcomes
.
It
refers
primarily
to
justice
and
fairness
,
and
may
require
different
treatment
,
or
special
measures
,
for
some
persons
or
groups
.
Equity
recognises
the
specific
conditions
or
characteristics
of
each
person
,
group
,
sex
,
gender
,
class
,
religion
or
age
.
It
requires
eliminating
all
barriers
to
economic
and
political
opportunities
and
access
to
education
and
basic
services
,
such
that
men
and
women
of
all
ages
,
conditions
and
positions
can
enjoy
these
opportunities
and
benefit
from
them
.
Gender
equity
means
fairness
of
treatment
for
women
and
men
,
according
to
their
respective
needs
.
This
may
include
equality
of
treatment
that
is
different

which
is
considered
equivalent
in
terms
of
rights
,
benefits
,
obligations
and
opportunities

<LINE# 1441>
Ideas
should
not
be
left
at

,
they

If

they

not
happen

<LINE# 1282>
This
is
the

in
developing

to
take
into

the

for
discretionary

needed
to
take
the

forward
,
which
comes
from

the

Finally
,
it

Citizen
power
–
people
take
responsibility
for
their
own
actions
and
do
not
depend
on
someone
else
to
do
it
for
them
.
For
example
a
pot
hole
in
the
road
is
uncovered
and
dangerous
.
The
community
decides
to
meet
and
elects
a
committee
to
take
it
up
directly
with
the
city
council
.
In
the
meantime
they
put
a
sign
up
warning
residents
to
be
careful
.
They
pursue
the
matter
until
the
council
attends
to
it
.

lose
interest
in
what
you
have
to
say
.

THE

of
the
Local

:
Municipal

Chapter
5
of
the
MSA
,
2000
calls
for
‘

to
adopt
a
single
,
inclusive
and
strategic
plan
for
the
development
of
the
municipality
’
(

)
)
.
The
plan
runs
for
five
years
and
is
the
broad
framework
for
development
within
the
area
.
It
is
reviewed
annually
.
The
IDP
guides
the
plan
of
action
of
the
municipality
and
must
(
by
law
)
be
developed
in
consultation
with
the
local
community
.

The
different

are

the

will
achieve
,
and
what

Monitoring
:
Communities

as
well
as
to
advise
the

It

Structured
participation
:
Most
of
the
new

are
too
big
in
terms
of
population
size
and
area
to
allow
for
direct
participation
of
the
majority
of
the
residents
in
complex
planning
processes
.
Participation
in
integrated
development
planning
,
therefore
,
needs
clear
rules
and
procedures
specifying
who
is
to
participate
or
to
be
consulted
,
on
behalf
of
whom
,
on
which
issue
,
through
which
organisational
mechanism
,
with
what
effect
.
<LINE# 0212>
The

matrix
provides
a
summary

HIV
/
AIDS
has
had
a
profound
effect
on
the
population
,
raising
overall
deaths
significantly
since
2000
and
reducing
the
proportion
of
women
of
child
-
bearing
age
.
There
are
signs
that
the
country
has
begun
to
turn
the
corner
in
response
to
an
effective
education
and
treatment
campaign
.
The
HIV
infection
rate
has
stabilised
at
about
10
percent
.
New
infections
among
young
people
have
fallen
and
life
expectancy
is
rising
.
Despite
these
gains
,
there
will
still
be
a
sizeable
number
of
AIDS
orphans
and
children
requiring
concerted
support
from
the
state
and
communities
for
decades
to
come

Over
the
next
several
years
the
world
economy
is
expected
to
grow
at
a
modest
pace
.
In
these
circumstances
,
South
African
businesses
need
to
think
carefully
about
what
they
produce
,
for
which
markets
,
using
what
capabilities
.
As
a
small
open
economy
,
South
Africa
can
develop
niche
products
.
Capturing
a
small
share
of
global
demand
in
areas
where
local
firms
can
compete
can
have
a
big
impact
.
For
example
,
South
Africa
could
be
a
global
leader
in
manufactured
goods
and
services
for
the
mining
industry
,
where
it
has
substantial
know
-
how
.
This
would
make
an
important
contribution
to
industrialisation
in
a
global
niche
market
.
<LINE# 1309>
Phase
1
starts
by
gathering
all
the
available
information
about
the
ward
to
establish
a
context
for
planning
.
This
includes
IDP
priorities
,
areas
which
the
municipality
is
likely
to
fund
and
information
about
other
service
providers
.
The
summary
below
outlines
how
to
go
about
collecting
this
information
.
<LINE# 1981>
The
key
performance
areas
in
a
ward
are
those
identified
through
the
IDP
and
implementation
processes
.
Ward
Committees
should
ensure
that
the
needs
of
their
area
are
addressed
through
their
involvement
in
the
IDP
process
.
In
discussions
with
municipal
councillors
and
officials
the
expectations
of
their
area
should
be
voiced
and
highlighted
.
<LINE# 1577>
Ward
Committees
have
been
widely
applied
as
a
way
of
structuring
municipal
-
community
relations
.
In
compiling
the
IDP
,
Ward
Committees
play
a
crucial
role
in
providing
community
input
and
needs
assessment
that
can
feed
into
the
IDP
but
also
in
facilitating
pubic
review
of
the
IDP
implementation
and
municipal
performance
against
the
IDP
.
<LINE# 0675>
Delegated
power
–
The
local
council
has
responsibility
for
making
decisions
and
funding
projects
.
They
can
however
delegate
some
responsibility
to
representative
/
s
of
the
community
to
help
them
fulfil
the
task
.
<LINE# 2173>
Avoid
merely
reflecting
or
replicating
the
existing
arrangement
of
political
power
of
the
elected
council
.
Ward
Committees
need
to
reflect
the
voice
of
the
community
.
<LINE# 2357>
This
is
the
phase
which
requires
action
in
the
form
of
a
response
or
a
reaction
.
For
example
,
a
response
may
involve
shouting
or
hitting
or
talking
or
choosing
to
leave
the
situation
.
People
respond
to
a
conflict
influenced
by
their
personal
set
of
attitudes
and
beliefs
.
<LINE# 1740>
Compared
with
the
best
international
standards
,
South
Africa
’s
ICT
infrastructure
is
abysmal
.
Efficient
information
infrastructure
that
promotes
economic
growth
and
greater
inclusion
requires
a
stronger
broadband
and
telecommunications
network
,
and
lower

.
The
economic
and
employment
benefits
outweigh
the
costs
.

THE
MUNICIPAL

ACT
,
2000
,
Chapters
4
and
5
,
requires
that
municipal
councils
develop
mechanisms
to
consult
and

.
This
is
supported
by
the
National
Policy
Framework
for
Public

,
2005
which
defines
public
participation
as
‘
an
open
,
accountable
process
through
which
individuals
and
groups
within
selected
communities
can
exchange

would
need
to

give

The

<LINE# 1888>
A
number
of
municipalities
have
formulated
policies
,
or
their
own
regulatory
frameworks
,
for
Ward
Committees
in
their
municipality
.
The
policies
regulate
the
establishment
,
operations
and
functioning
of
Ward
Committees
in
their
municipality
and
provide
a
clear
outline
of
the
systems
and
procedures
that
will
help
Ward
Committees
to
operate
successfully
.
The
policies
must
be
adapted
because
each
municipality
is
different
and
should
try
and
put
in
place
policies
that
are
most
suitable
for
their
needs
so
that
they
can
service
their
communities
effectively

Gender
roles
are
learned
behaviours
in
a
particular
society
,
community
or
other
social
group
.
They
condition
activities
,
tasks
and
responsibilities
are
perceived
as
male
or
female
.
They
are
treated
as
natural
,
but
they
are
not
.
Gender
roles
are
affected
by
age
,
class
,
race
,
ethnicity
and
religion
,
and
by
the
geographical
,
economic
and
political
environment
.
They
are
also
often
oppressive
to
women
.
For
example
,
a
women
’s
sex
makes
it
her
job
to
breast
-
feed
a
baby
.
But
when
the
baby
is
weaned
,
it
is
still
the
women
’s
job
to
feed
the
baby
because
society
expects
that
from
her
.
This
is
her
gender
role
.
The
man
can
just
as
easily
do
the
job
since
there
is
nothing
biological
that
prevents
him
from
shopping
,
cooking
food
and
feeding
the
baby
.
Most
men
do
not
do
housework
because
it
is
seen
as
women
’s
work

improvement
.
Actual
performance
should
be
measured

There

trade
near

There
have
been
complaints
from
shop
owners
that
the
hawkers
do
n’t
pay
rent
so
they
can
sell
their
goods
cheaper

that

Small
business
support
:
In
1994
a
British
aid
agency
made
funding
available
for
the
establishment
of
an
LED
desk
.
The
aim
of
the
LED
desk
is
to
provide
training
,
small
business
support
and
loans
.
Despite
this
intervention
,
small
businesses
in
the
area
have
experienced
a
high
failure
rate
as
a
result
of
the
limited
market
for
products
in
the
town
,
the
low
incomes
of
most
residents
,
lack
of
transport
for
the
producers
to
sell
their
goods
elsewhere
and
a
general
lack
of
training
.

Part
of
our
approach
to
social
protection
is
through
a
social
wage
,
which
includes
no

schools
,
free
basic
services
and
subsidised
public
transport
.
In
addition
to
creating
more
jobs
in
the
private
sector
,
a
significant
broadening
of
public
employment
programmes
will
also
help
to
ensure
that
fewer
households
live

a
determined

level
